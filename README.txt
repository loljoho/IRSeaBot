IRSeaBot: The c# .NET 5 IRC bot.

I created this bot because I am a windows user,and I wanted a reliable 
bot that I could serve from IIS with minimal effort. 

If you want to run the bot, you will need to produce the settings file referenced in the IRCBot class.

In addition, you will need to get yourself an api key for the weather api and the youtube api.

Likes and Seen files are stored in your app data folder.
