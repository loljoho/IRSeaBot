IRSeaBot: The c# .NET 5 IRC bot.

I created this bot because I am a windows user,and I wanted a reliable bot that I could serve from IIS with minimal effort. 

If you want to run the bot, you will need to produce the settings file with your database connection string.

In addition, you will need to get yourself an api key for the weather api and the youtube api.
